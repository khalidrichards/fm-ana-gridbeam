    description: 'Architecture + Advocacy’s mission is to equip everyday people with the tools of architecture, so they can drive development that improves their quality of life, without experiencing displacement. Inspired by personal experiences with neighborhood inequality and its intersections with race, gender, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic injustice, A+A combines grassroots organizing with tangible, architectural impacts. Our combination of architecture workshops, community-led design-builds, and leadership development programs– in addition to A+A’s strong network of community partnerships– work toward our goal of community-led design.\n\nThis collaboration with Flatbush Mixtape will alter the systems of design by putting the tools and knowledge for spatial change in the hands of community members. Flatbush Mix-Beam Kit enables the Flatbush Community to produce their own creations to meet the neighborhood\'s needs and desires.',
